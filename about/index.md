# About

I am a data scientist by title and a mathematician by training. I help run the remote teaching practice at [TEALS](http://www.tealsk12.org/) and have worked with folks from the [Center for Data Science and Public Policy](http://dsapp.uchicago.edu) at the University of Chicago, and was Principal Data Scientist at [Knewton](http://www.knewton.com/) for several years.

If you'd like to contact me, please reach out at `<my_first_initial><my_middle_initial><my_last_name>@gmail.com`.
