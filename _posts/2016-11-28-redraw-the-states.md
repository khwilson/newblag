I have been meaning to learn even a rudimentary amount about [D3](http://d3js.org) for a very long time. A fun question from my grad school classmate [Kevin Hughes](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/maths/people/kevin-j-hughes/index.html) provided the perfect opportunity. Specifically, we want to know "How stable is the Electoral College under small changes in geography?" The answer is, "Extremely unstable."

To answer the question, I built a medium-sized tool I call [Redraw the
States](http://www.redrawthestates.com). I found that there were many
combinations of 4 counties that, if moved to a neighboring state, would flip
the election to Clinton. There's also at least one combination of three
counties (Lake, IL -> WI; Lucas (Toledo), OH -> MI; Camden, NJ -> PA) that
would do the same. Can you find any better combinations? Let me know if you do,
e.g., by tweeting @khayeswilson.

For a in depth writeup, see my [medium post](http://medium.com/@khayeswilson/clinton-would-have-won-if-the-united-states-looked-like-this-7b9c844b76a9) on the subject.
